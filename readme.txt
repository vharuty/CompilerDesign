HOW TO RUN


1. Copy source files into a directory, copy folder "files" into the same folder 
   as  exe (I have it already but just in case). 

2. Open the project in Visual Studio 2012, Build it then run

3. In the begginning the program asks to enter file name => copy full path into the screen(for simplicity)

4. program outputs files into ".\files\output\" directory. The deep description what does output files contain is in the document.

5. Test cases are located in ".\files\TestCases_Assignment#4" folder
